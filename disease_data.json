Aloe vera gel (pure, without additives) can soothe minor skin irritation. Chamomile tea bags cooled and applied to irritated areas can reduce inflammation.

Generalized demodicosis — widespread hair loss and secondary infections, requires aggressive treatment. Treatment now uses isoxazoline drugs (Bravecto, NexGard, Simparica) as first-line treatment, as well as ivermectin and topical moxidectin. Breeds predisposed include Pit Bulls, Staffordshire Terriers, Shar-Peis, and English Bulldogs.

Diagnosis involves Wood's lamp examination (only some Microsporum strains fluoresce), fungal culture (gold standard, takes 2-3 weeks), and skin biopsy.

Treatment typically involves antibacterial shampoos containing chlorhexidine or benzoyl peroxide, and oral antibiotics for 3-6 weeks.
